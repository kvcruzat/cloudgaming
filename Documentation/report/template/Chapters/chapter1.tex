\section{Context}
Cloud computing has always been seen as a way of improving compute performance by the
use of multiple computers connected to each other. The games industry has rapidly evolved
along the years and a great deal of demand is apparent. Developers of games have pushed
computer hardware to meet the needs of consumers for more complicated games and
realism. Even with computer hardware becoming cheaper and more of a commodity, the
costs of driving graphics rendering for high-end games to run at the optimal settings of
1080p at 60fps are still relatively high.
