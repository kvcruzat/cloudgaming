\section{Context}
Cloud computing has always been seen as a way of improving compute performance by the use of multiple computers connected to each other. The games industry has rapidly evolved along the years and a great deal of demand is apparent. Developers of games have pushed computer hardware to meet the needs of consumers for more complicated games and realism. Even with computer hardware becoming cheaper and more of a commodity, the costs of driving graphics rendering for high-end games to run at the optimal settings of 1080p at 60fps are still relatively high.

\section{Project Aim}
The aim of the project is to produce a solution which uses Software-Defined Networking to reduce the network latency in a network.

\section{Project Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A simple game program, that is computationally expensive enough to not perform optimally on a single machine (simple flight simulator with real time procedurally generated trees).
  \item A simplified cloud gaming system where the game created is launched on the cloud and input on the client side in the form of button presses on the keyboard is sent to the game on the server. The game frames produced are then sent to the client's screen.
  \item Produce a virtual network with simulated cloud game traffic and delay. With the use of SDN, reduce latency in the network.
\end{itemize}

\section{Deliverables}
The deliverables of the project include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Code that demonstrates a simple game/simulation rendering graphics on a server and controlled by a client remotely.
  \item A manual on how to setup the client and server will be produced so the cloud gaming system can be easily setup and launched. 
  \item Code that will create a virtual network as well as a manual on how to set it up and run the code.
  \item Project report that explains the problem the project is trying to solve and the schematics of the solution produced as well as an evaluation of the solution.
\end{itemize}
